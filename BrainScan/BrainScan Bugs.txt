Using hashlife renderer to render the brain. Need to find where the parser is for this thing.

The key is fill_square.
Seems the offset isn't working right... fix it.[DONE]

Check if the brain is supposed to have holes, check other nifti files.[FIXED]

So, we need a way to change the backgrounds of all the buttons
We will need to store all the shapes of the buttons
(Would it be easier to compute the shapes everytime they are changed?)
(Will need to test that.)

Let's first implement a single person then we will worry about how to change the buttons

Okay, we need to figure out how to keep the buttons away from each other.
Easy way would be a greedy approach.
Buttons NEVER need to move once we give them their coordinates.
We will be using a greedy approach. 
The button coordinates need to be stored correctly
We will have a 2d array scaled to 8x8/coordinate, we will fill the 2darray as we determine button coordinates

Allow them to toggle chems and the age
Purpose is to replace the numbers, we don't need to display numbers

Need to be able to see where regions are at a glance.
(Say I wanted to find the Anterior corona radiata left, how would I find that?)
